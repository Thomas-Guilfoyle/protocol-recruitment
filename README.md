Protocol Recruitment is a site I made for a family friend. He plans to start his recruitment business in the coming months, so I saw it as an opportunity where we could help each other. This site should showcase jobs that may be available on a regular basis, primarily in the Irish midland. The site will be targeted towards jobseekers who want to apply for jobs, and employers who can avail of the services of the business to find the perfect fit they need for a position at their company.

## UX

### Project Goals
This website is for potential employers and jobseekers who would like to apply for jobs.

### Colors
The future business owner told me he's not fussy about the color scheme. I always loved the pairing of blue and orange, as it looks fun but classy. So I went with rgb(28, 165, 199) rgb(251, 166, 57).

### Typography
After extensively  browsing through Google Fonts, I went with the pairing of Bebas Neue for headings and Roboto for everything else:

### Images
I chose the images from a wide range on Pixabay. I selected the ones on the site as they look very professional and suited to a recruitment agency.

### Wireframes
I created some wireframes before starting to build. These can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zM3ujNM9fpBwr_hhxZGYO-C8S36clPEH/view?usp=sharing). I stuck mostly to the design I originally had in mind.

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on 5 pages, but not featured on the 404.html page. The full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home Page, Jobs Page, Services Page and the About us page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation. It also makes an appearance on the Contct Page, which is linked in the job's description.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

- __The landing page image__

  - The landing includes a photograph with text overlay to allow the user to see exactly what the business is about and who this site would be applicable to. 
  - This section introduces the user to Protocol Recruitment with an eye-catching animation to grab their attention.

- __User Category Section__

  - The user category section will allow the user to easily navigate to which part of the site that is applicable to them.

- __Job Category Section__

  - This section will allow the user to see exactly which industries the business caters to.

- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section includes a mini navigation bar to the left for convenience. This also features a 'back to top' link which will bring the user to the top of the page without the unnecessary scrolling. In the middle I included information such as address, phone number and email address (these are placeholders, as I didn't want to make details accessible until the business is open). And finally, on the right, I have links to the relevant social media sites for the business (placeholders). The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media

- __The 404 Section__
  - This page is to tell they user that they're in a place that doesn't exist and/or they clicked on a broken link. I styled it with the same colors I used for the rest of the site:

### Future Enhancements

- I would like to add a 'share' options to jobs, so users can share a job to someone that the role might suit.
- I plan to create some more pages for the job categories when the business is opened and has some roles to advertise. Furthermore, I will link these to the job category section on the homepage then.
- In the future, I might add a 'contact' page separately.

## Testing 

- I continuously tested using Google Dev Tools, ensuring everything on all devices was working as it should. This proved to be extremely helpful as it allowed me to identify some flaws.
- I used my 3 personal devices, and the computer I use for my job, to test every page rigorously. I used a range of devices, including a Dell Latitude 5420, a Samsung Galaxy S21, an iPhone 11, iPhone SE and a HP Chromebook. I also have a docking station for the Dell Latitude at home, and at work, that are plugged into monitors with various screen sizes.
- My friends and family were very helpful with the testing. I asked a few people to be picky with their assessment. I would have missed this, if my friends Stephen and Kevin didn't spot it on their devices:

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS

### Unfixed Bugs

I have a bug that got the better of me. While viewing the website on some iOS devices, the list markers don't actually show up:


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84339381/126800311-11167a65-93eb-43ef-a47c-cc8603a2c08d.png)


I read [this](https://support.balbooa.com/forum/gridbox/9169-problem-with-li-marker-on-ios-not-showing-up) article and couldn't get anything from it. This is something I will continue to work on until it's fixed.
